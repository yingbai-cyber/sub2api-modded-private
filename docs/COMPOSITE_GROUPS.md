# Composite Groups

Composite groups are an admin routing layer for API keys that should choose a
concrete provider from the requested model instead of binding the key to a
single provider group. They support both built-in model detection and an
admin-configured model route registry for public model aliases.

## Supported Providers

Composite groups can route to these concrete account platforms:

- Anthropic
- Gemini
- OpenAI
- Antigravity
- Grok

The selected concrete platform is used for account selection, user platform
quota checks, post-usage billing, ops error platform attribution, channel
mapping/pricing lookup, and platform usage reporting.

## Route Registry

Admins can configure routes on a composite group from the group list's
`Routes` action or through the admin API:

- `GET /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes`
- `POST /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes`
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes/:route_id`
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes/:route_id`
- `POST /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes/preview`

Each route belongs to one composite group and contains:

- `public_model`: model identifier the client sends.
- `match_type`: `exact` or `prefix`.
- `target_platform`: concrete provider platform.
- `upstream_model`: model identifier sent upstream. If omitted, the public
  model is reused.
- `endpoint`: `any`, `messages`, `count_tokens`, `responses`,
  `chat_completions`, `embeddings`, `images`, or `gemini`.
- `priority`: lower values win after match specificity.
- `enabled`: disabled routes are ignored by runtime resolution but remain
  visible to admins.

Resolution order is explicit route first, then built-in detection. When more
than one explicit route matches, exact matches beat prefix matches,
endpoint-specific routes beat `any`, longer prefixes beat shorter prefixes,
then lower `priority`, then lower route id.

For JSON-body endpoints, the gateway rewrites the request `model` field to the
route's `upstream_model` before dispatch. For Gemini native paths such as
`/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`, the gateway resolves `{model}` and
the handler forwards the resolved upstream model.

## Built-In Detection

Composite routing detects common public model IDs and provider-prefixed IDs:

- `claude-*` and `anthropic/claude-*` route to Anthropic.
- `gemini-*` and `google/gemini-*` route to Gemini.
- `gpt-*`, `o*`, `codex-*`, `text-embedding-*`, `dall-e-*`, and
  `openai/*` route to OpenAI.
- `grok-*` and `xai/grok-*` route to Grok.

Unknown or ambiguous model names fail closed with a client error instead of
guessing a provider.

## Admin Workflows

- Admins can create a group with platform `composite`.
- Admins can add, edit, delete, and preview composite model routes.
- Composite groups can copy accounts from concrete provider groups.
- Concrete provider accounts can be assigned directly to composite groups from
  account create/edit and bulk account workflows.
- Channel configuration exposes composite groups in concrete provider sections.
  The channel `group_ids` payload is still flat; provider-specific model
  mapping and pricing remain keyed by concrete platform.

## Limits

Composite routes choose a concrete provider and upstream model; they do not
create synthetic model metadata, pricing, or upstream capability records by
themselves. Keep channel pricing/model mapping configured for the concrete
provider platforms that the routes target.
